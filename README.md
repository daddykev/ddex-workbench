> An open-source suite of modern, accessible tools for working with DDEX standards in the digital music industry.

## üéØ Vision

DDEX Workbench aims to democratize access to the digital music supply chain by providing web-based, collaborative tools that lower the barrier to entry for DDEX implementation. From independent artists to major labels, our tools make DDEX standards accessible to everyone.

## üöÄ Project Overview

### Phase 1: DDEX Connect (Current Focus)
A modern web-based ERN 4.3 validator with community knowledge sharing capabilities.

**Why it matters:**
- DDEX is mandating migration to ERN 4.3 by March 2025
- Zero maintained open-source tools currently support ERN 4.3
- The industry urgently needs accessible validation tools

### Key Features

#### Web Validator Interface
- **Drag-and-drop** file upload for XML files
- **Monaco editor** for pasting and editing XML directly
- **Line-by-line error highlighting** with detailed messages
- **DDEX KB links** for understanding and fixing errors
- Support for ERN 4.3 (expandable to other versions)

#### Public Validation API
```javascript
// POST /api/validate
{
  "content": "<xml>...</xml>",
  "type": "ERN",
  "version": "4.3",
  "profile": "AudioAlbum"
}
```

#### Community Knowledge Base
- Searchable snippet library for common DDEX patterns
- Community voting and comments
- Real-world examples for complex scenarios
- Direct integration with validator

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Vue 3** with Composition API
- **Vite** for lightning-fast builds
- **Monaco Editor** for XML editing

### Backend
- **Firebase** platform
- **Cloud Functions** for serverless validation
- **Firestore** for data persistence
- **Firebase Auth** for user management
- **Cloud Storage** for file handling
